[‚Üê Back to README](../README.md)

This demo shows how Claude uses the `apple-health-mcp-server` to answer questions about your data. Example prompts from the demo:
- I would like you to help me analyze my Apple Health data. Let's start by analyzing the data types - check what data is available and how much of it there is.
- What can you tell me about my activity in the last week? How did my daily statistics look?
- Please also summarise my running workouts in July and June. Do you see anything interesting?
