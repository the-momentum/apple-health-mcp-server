# Roadmap

[‚Üê Back to README](../README.md)

We're continuously enhancing Apple Health MCP Server with new capabilities. Here's what's on the horizon:

- [ ] **Time Series Sampling During Import**: Add advanced analytical tools to sample and generate time series data directly during the XML-to-Elasticsearch loading process.
- [ ] **Optimized XML Tools**: Improve the performance and efficiency of XML parsing and querying tools.
- [ ] **Expanded Elasticsearch Analytics**: Add more advanced analytics and aggregation functions to the Elasticsearch toolset.
- [ ] **Embedded Database Tools**: Integrate tools for working with embedded databases for local/offline analytics and storage.

Have a suggestion? We'd love to hear from you! Contact us or contribute directly.
