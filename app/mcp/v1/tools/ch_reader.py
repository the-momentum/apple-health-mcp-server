    Search health records in Elasticsearch with flexible query building.

    Parameters:
    - params: HealthRecordSearchParams object containing all search/filter parameters.

    Notes for LLMs:
    - This function should return a list of health record documents (dicts) matching the search criteria.
    - Each document in the list should represent a single health record as stored in Elasticsearch.
    - If an error occurs, the function should return a list with a single dict containing an 'error' key and the error message.
    - Use this to retrieve structured health data for further analysis, filtering, or display.
    - Example source_name: "Robâ€™s iPhone", "Polar Flow", "Sync Solver".
    - Example date_from/date_to: "2020-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"
    - Example value_min/value_max: "10", "100.5"

    """
    Get comprehensive statistics for a specific health record type from Elasticsearch.

    Parameters:
    - record_type: The type of health record to analyze. Use RecordType for most frequent types. Use str if that type is beyond RecordType scope.

    Returns:
    - record_type: The analyzed record type
    - total_count: Total number of records of this type in the index
    - value_statistics: Statistical summary of the 'value' field including:
      * count: Number of records with values
      * min: Minimum value recorded
      * max: Maximum value recorded
      * avg: Average value across all records
      * sum: Sum of all values
    - sources: Breakdown of records by source device/app (e.g., "Rob's iPhone", "Polar Flow")

    Notes for LLMs:
    - This function provides comprehensive statistical analysis for any health record type.
    - The value_statistics object contains all basic statistics (count, min, max, avg, sum) for the 'value' field.
    - The sources breakdown shows which devices/apps contributed data for this record type.
    - Example types: "HKQuantityTypeIdentifierStepCount", "HKQuantityTypeIdentifierBodyMassIndex", "HKQuantityTypeIdentifierHeartRate", etc.
    - Use this function to understand the distribution, range, and trends of specific health metrics.
    - The function is useful for health analysis, identifying outliers, and understanding data quality.
    - date_range key for query is commented, since it contained hardcoded from date, but you can use it anyway if you replace startDate with your data.
    - IMPORTANT - Do not guess, auto-fill, or assume any missing data.
    - When asked for medical advice, try to use my data from ElasticSearch first.
